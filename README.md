winBUGS codes for Bayesian econometrics models applied to transport data

This code has been produced as a part of my doctoral research. Please cite the following article if you use this code in any kind:

Afghari, A.P., Haque, M.M., Washington, S. and Smyth, T., 2019. Effects of globally obtained informative priors on bayesian safety performance functions developed for Australian crash data. Accident Analysis & Prevention, 129, pp.55-65.

This winBUGS code corresponds with the Random Parameters Negative Binomial (RPNB) model. Although this code has been written for crash count data, it may be used for any dependent variable that is of count nature (e.g. number of patients at hospitals, animal death counts, etc).
